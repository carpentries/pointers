# About Pointers

Teaching data science often requires instructors to provide example datasets to students who are learning to use tools and methods. While open datasets are increasingly common, open data that is prepared for specific use cases, such as teaching specific tools or methods, is less common. The ADSA and Carpentries communities have expressed interest in curating a corpus of open datasets that could be used for data science education, capstone projects, and pedagogical research. While many open datasets exist for teaching and research, this collection, Pointers, provides a space for curated datasets and related curricula that others can use, modify, and share at will. 

Pointers is a joint project of [The Academic Data Science Alliance](adsa-home) and [The Carpentries](carpentries-home).
